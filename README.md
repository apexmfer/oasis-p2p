## Oasis P2P 


#### Getting Started 


Install ipfs 

        https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/#official-distributions


Start IPFS with 'ipfs daemon' 

Visit 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui' to see the interface 




#### How it works 


oasis-manifest files will be stored on IPFS too so you can just fetch them from there
