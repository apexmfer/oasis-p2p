/*
    Singleton Loop Method

    Instantiate this class with a Promise(method) and an array of args

    Call the start() method on the instance in order to continuously call the method in a loop.  If an instance of the method is currently executing, it will not execute another time -- it will skip. 

    In this way, the execution code will only be running in a single instance at any given time.  However, the code will loop forever until stop() is called
